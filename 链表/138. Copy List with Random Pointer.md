### Description

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list.

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://discuss.leetcode.com/uploads/files/1470150906153-2yxeznm.png)**

```
Input:
{"$id":"1","next":{"$id":"2","next":null,"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":2},"random":{"$ref":"2"},"val":1}

Explanation:
Node 1's value is 1, both of its next and random pointer points to Node 2.
Node 2's value is 2, its next pointer points to null and its random pointer points to itself.
```

 

**Note:**

1. You must return the **copy of the given head** as a reference to the cloned list.



### Thinking

使用HashMap对链表进行复制

### Solution

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node next;
    public Node random;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val,Node _next,Node _random) {
        val = _val;
        next = _next;
        random = _random;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
        public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        Map<Node, Node> map = new HashMap<>();
        Node cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            Node node = new Node(cur.val,null,null);
            map.put(cur, node);
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        cur = head;
        while (cur != null) {
            Node node = map.get(cur);
            node.next = map.get(cur.next);
            node.random = map.get(cur.random);
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        return map.get(head);
    }

}
```
